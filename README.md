Training an agent to play Bomberman with Reinforcement Learning

Note: In this project I did not use any framework for setting up a game agent, retrieving game state or automating mouse/keyboard input. Because of that, I soon ran into a lot of headaches. Therefore, I decided to give the [SerpentAI framework](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI) a try, in which you can write plugins for both the game as well as the agent. I'm working on that code in the following repositories:
* [Bomberman Game Plugin](https://github.com/danielmast/bomberman_game)
* [Bomberman Game Agent Plugin](https://github.com/danielmast/bomberman_agent)
